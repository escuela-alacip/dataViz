Contents:

Part 1:

Using Acrobat Reader, open the file **hsb.pdf**, and decide which of those columns are nominal, ordinal or numerical (integer or decimal). Then open the file **hsb.sav**, which is in SPSS format. You can use the library **rio** (function _import_) or **foreign** (function _read.spss_) to open it. Make sure to find out the arguments needed in each function.



Part 2:

Make two barplots for one nominal variable. The first one should have _title_ and _source_, but no more changes to the default given by ggplot. The second plot should include more customized changes of your choice.

Part 3:

Make two boxplots for one ordinal variable. The first one should have _title_ and _source_, but no more changes to the default given by ggplot. The second plot should include more customized changes of your choice.

Part 4:

Make two histograms for one numerical variable. The first one should have _title_ and _source_, but no more changes to the default given by ggplot. The second plot should include more customized changes of your choice.

Part 5:

Make an alternative plot for the nominal and the numerical variable. Customize it with the elements of your choice. 

Part 6 (For final project):

1. Download the data you have collected from one source.
2. Input it to R. 
3. Summarize what you see. Select one variable and create one plot based on what you have.
